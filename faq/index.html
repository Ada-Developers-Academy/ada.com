<h2>What is ADA?</h2>
Ada Developers' Academy is a software development school in Seattle, Washington that is exclusively for women. 

<h2>When?</h2>
ADA's inaugural class will begin October, 2013. The academy will feature two sections: 24 weeks of intensive in-class instruction, followed by up to six months of apprenticeship at a Puget Sound region tech company. 

<h2>What Will I Learn?</h2>
You'll come out of the academy with a full tool belt as a web developer. You'll learn Ruby, Rails, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. You'll also leave with the know-how to pick up other programming languages.

<h2>How Much Does ADA Cost?</h2>
Ada Developers' Academy has no tuition and students will receive a $1,000 monthly living stipend for the duration of the class and internship.

<h2>Should I Apply?</h2>
If you have an interest in technology and want to transition into a career in software development, please apply! We're looking for women without prior programming experience, but with high motivation and aptitude. 

<h2>What Kind of Job Can I Expect?</h2>
We'll train you to become a full-stack developer, but very likely you'll find a particular part of software development that really suits you. You'll be ready for a job as a web developer, whether it's full-stack, front-end, QA, UX - it's up to you!
