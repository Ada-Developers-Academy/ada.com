        <section id="learn">
          <h2>What Will I Learn?</h2>
          <p> You’ll come out of the academy with a full tool belt as a web developer. You’ll learn Ruby, Rails, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll also leave with the know-how to pick up other programming languages.
          </p>  
          <hr/>
        </section> 
        <section id="cost"> 
          <h2>How Much Does Ada Cost?</h2>
          <p> Ada Developers Academy has no tuition and students are eligible to receive a $1,000 monthly living stipend for the duration of the class and internship. 
          </p>  
          <p> The best way to learn to program is to become immersed in it. Because Ada is not-for-profit, we have the ability to put students first. We want to attract the best possible candidates, regardless of financial situation, and make it as easy as possible to succeed.

         <section id="supplies"> 
            <h2>Do I Need Any Supplies?</h2>
            <p> You will need a newer-model (less than one year old) <a href="http://apple.com/mac" target="blank">Mac</a> laptop. The majority of the support, documentation, and instructions are written with the Mac environment in mind. It's much easier to begin programming <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/" target="blank">Ruby</a> on a Mac, and we want all Ada students to be able to use the same materials without any hiccups.  
            </p>  
            <p> We recommend a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" target="bland"> MacBook Air </a> or a<a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/features/" target="blank"> MacBook Pro</a>. The base models of each (11" MacBook Air and the 13" MacBook Pro) are sufficient for class. If you are unable to purchase a laptop and require financial assistance, please note it on your application. 
            </p>
            <p> All books, software, and other materials will be provided by Ada.</p>

          <h2>Should I Apply?</h2>
          <p> If you have an interest in technology and want to transition into a career in software development, please apply! We’re looking for women without prior programming experience, but with high motivation and aptitude.

        <section id="job">
          <h2>What Kind of Job Can I Expect?</h2>
          <p> We’ll train you to become a full-stack developer, but very likely you’ll find a particular part of software development that really suits you. You’ll be ready for a job as a web developer, whether it’s full-stack, front-end, QA, UX - it’s up to you!
