            <h2>Do I Need Any Supplies?</h2>
            <p> You will need a newer-model (less than one year old) <a href="http://apple.com/mac" target="blank">Mac</a> laptop. The majority of the support, documentation, and instructions are written with the Mac environment in mind. It's much easier to begin programming <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/" target="blank">Ruby</a> on a Mac, and we want all Ada students to be able to use the same materials without any hiccups.
            </p>
            <p> We recommend a <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-air/" target="bland"> MacBook Air </a> or a<a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/features/" target="blank"> MacBook Pro</a>. The base models of each (11" MacBook Air and the 13" MacBook Pro) are sufficient for class. If you are unable to purchase a laptop and require financial assistance, please note it on your application.
            </p>

        <section id="job">
          <h2>What Kind of Job Can I Expect?</h2>
          <p> We’ll train you to become a full-stack developer, but very likely you’ll find a particular part of software development that suits you. You’ll be ready for a job as a web developer, whether it’s full-stack, front-end, QA, UX - it’s up to you.
