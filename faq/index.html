        <section id="learn">
          <h2>What Will I Learn?</h2>
          <p> You’ll come out of the academy with a full tool belt as a web developer. You’ll learn Ruby, Rails, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll also leave with the know-how to pick up other programming languages.

        <section id="cost"> 
          <h2>How Much Does Ada Cost?</h2>
          <p> Ada Developers Academy has no tuition and students are eligible to receive a $1,000 monthly living stipend for the duration of the class and internship. 
          </p>  
          <p> The best way to learn to program is to become immersed in it. Because Ada is not-for-profit, we have the ability to put students first. We want to attract the best possible candidates, regardless of financial situation, and make it as easy as possible to succeed.
