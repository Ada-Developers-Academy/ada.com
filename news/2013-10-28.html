      <h1>Ada Developers Academy Welcomes Inaugural Class</h1>
      <h4>Sixteen women begin year-long journey toward a new career in the software industry</h4>
      <p>Seattle, WA, October 28, 2013 – Ada Developer’s Academy, the first-of-its-kind program that combines intensive instruction and company apprenticeships to prepare women for new careers in programming, officially welcomed its inaugural class of 16 students today.</p>

      <p>A total of 107 women interested in pursuing a career in programming submitted an application package, including a personal video and answers to a technical reading and logic assessment. The Ada selection committee interviewed 33 applicants and offered places to 16 prospective students. All 16 accepted Ada’s invitation to blaze a new trail for women looking to build a new career in technology.</p>
      
      <p>“The response to Ada’s call for applications was overwhelmingly positive – not just from women in Washington but from across the country – and we're pleased to welcome such a talented and diverse group of future programmers,” said Rogers Weed, chair of the Ada Steering Committee and Technology Alliance board member.</p>
      
      <p>“As a former member of Washington’s technology industry who has observed the gender gap and need for better technical training first-hand, I am excited to be involved in this project and to enable our state to be a test-bed of such an innovative approach to our workforce needs.”</p>
      
      <p>Twelve of the students are Washington residents, while the remaining four moved to the state from as far away as Maryland and Texas. Half of the successful applicants are from underrepresented communities.</p>

      <p>The students were chosen for their aptitude and interest in software development, despite very little or no previous experience writing code. All of the students have at least some college-level education, with 14 of the women having completed a bachelor’s degree or higher in a field outside of computing. Roughly half of the students speak one or more languages in addition to English.</p>

      <p>“I've worked at a couple of the tech giants in the area, as well as startups. I've interviewed thousands of people in the process of hiring for hundreds of engineering roles. In my experience, the women in the first Ada cohort are among the brightest, most focused people I've encountered. Each and every one of them will be a high impact developer based on reviewing every one of their applications,” said Ted Bardusch, VP of Engineering and Operations at Marchex.</p>

     <p>Because of the overwhelming interest Ada has received, it continues to accept applications from women interested in being part of the spring 2014 cohort.</p>

      <p>“The competition for entry into this inaugural class was fierce, and the fact that we are already talking about the second class tells me that Ada has hit upon a winning formula for engaging more women in computing,” said Technology Alliance Executive Director Susannah Malarkey.</p>

      <p>“We also should recognize that the benefits of Ada will extend beyond the individuals of this class and of future classes: we are helping to address the growing talent needs of an industry that is a vital economic engine for our state.”</p>

      <p>Class officially begins today at the Ada Developers Academy in downtown Seattle. The students will complete six months of intensive classroom training and mentorship by experienced software professionals, followed by a six-month internship at a local technology company. Students who complete the program are guaranteed a job interview at the conclusion of their internship. In addition, many students will receive a $1,000 monthly stipend.</p>

      <p>Ada Developers Academy is made possible by support from the Technology Alliance, local technology companies, and more than 240 donors to its online fundraising campaign.</p>
