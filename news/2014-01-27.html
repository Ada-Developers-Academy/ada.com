      <h4>Thirteen companies commit funding and internships for first cohort of aspiring female software developers</h4>
      
      <p>Seattle, WA, January 27, 2014 – Ada Developers Academy (Ada), a unique training program that prepares women for careers in programming, announced today that it has sold out all available internship slots for its inaugural class.</p>

      <p>Thirteen local companies – from small, local startups to established, global firms – have committed to provide Ada Developers Academy students with hands-on programming experience through internships as members of their development teams. The companies include: Apex Learning, Chef, EnergySavvy, Expedia, Foundry Interactive, Health123, EMC Isilon, LiquidPlanner, Marchex, Moz, RealPage, Substantial, and Zillow.</p>

      <p>“The response from local tech leaders to the Ada program has been amazing. It was crucial for us to have community buy-in to make this model work, and they really stepped up to offer their support,” said Susannah Malarkey, Executive Director of the Technology Alliance.</p>

      <p>“Not only are the companies providing internships, but they have also supplied in-class mentors and guest lecturers, offered input on the curriculum to ensure that we were truly meeting industry needs, and enabled us to deliver the program tuition-free to students.”</p>

      <p>“I think companies recognized the value proposition of Ada, and that’s why they jumped at the chance to sponsor our class,” observed Rogers Weed, Chair of the Ada Steering Committee.</p>

      <p>“We are their conduit to a previously untapped source of promising new talent, at a time when software developers are in short supply in our state. And we are helping them to increase the diversity of their teams.”</p>

      <p>Ada provides six months of intensive, full-time classroom instruction followed by a six-month internship at a Seattle-area technology company. The program distinguishes itself from other developer training programs by providing a supportive, tuition-free pathway for women who display aptitude for programming to launch new careers in software development.</p>

      <p>“I've worked at a couple of the tech giants in the area as well as startups. I've interviewed thousands of people in the process of hiring for hundreds of engineering roles,” said Ted Bardusch, VP of Engineering and Operations at Marchex, an Ada sponsor.</p>

      <p>“In my experience, the women in the first Ada cohort are among the brightest, most focused people I've encountered. Each and every one of them will be a high impact developer.”</p>

      <p>Students in Ada’s first cohort will transition from the classroom to their on-site internships in May, when Ada will welcome a second cohort of students to its downtown Seattle classroom. Ada was launched with a combination of company sponsorships, individual donations, and a grant from the Washington State Department of Commerce.</p>

      <p>“This has been a true public-private partnership, and our goal is to build a sustainable program by, for, and of the technology community,” noted Malarkey.</p>

      <p>“Having closed on our first round of sponsorships, we are well on our way. Interested companies who missed out on the first class are welcome to participate as sponsors of cohort two.”</p>
