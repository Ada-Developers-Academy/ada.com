<h1>Why ADA?</h1>

    <p>
      Washington State has a major high-skilled labor shortage (25,000 unfilled high-skilled jobs and rising). 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most challenging roles to recruit within this labor pool is software developers, and over 85% of programmers are male. The lack of talent, combined with the gender gap, is problematic for Washington’s economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fill the unmet need and to help rectify the gender imbalance in software development, Washington needs a software development academy that prepares women for productive roles in technical positions. Ada Developers’ Academy is the solution.
