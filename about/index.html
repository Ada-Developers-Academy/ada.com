    <h2>What is ADA?</h2>
    <p>
      Ada Developers' Academy (ADA) is an intensive software developer training school for women. It combines six months of classroom instruction in cutting-edge web technologies with up to six month of apprenticeship at a Puget Sound-area tech business.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADA's inaugural class is slated to begin in October, 2013. In the 24 week intensive class, students will be immersed in software development and learn the most up-to-date web skills from leading regional and national experts. 
    </p>

    <h2>The ADA Curriculum</h2>
    <p>
      Ada Developers' Academy will teach full-stack web development. Students will learn Ruby, Rails, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, students will learn how to work on agile development teams, using pair programming, scrum, and test-driven development. 
    </p>

    <h2>Why ADA?</h2>
    <p>
      Washington State has a major high-skilled labor shortage (25,000 unfilled high-skilled jobs and rising). 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most challenging roles to recruit within this labor pool is software developers, and over 85% of programmers are male. The lack of talent, combined with the gender gap, is problematic for Washington’s economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fill the unmet need and to help rectify the gender imbalance in software development, Washington needs a software development academy that prepares women for productive roles in technical positions. Ada Developers’ Academy is the solution.

        <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> was the first programmer. She worked with Charles Babbage on the constrution and programming of the Analytical Engine. Although not implemented in her lifetime, her program to calculate a series of Bernoulli numbers was found to be functional and bug-free.
