      <h2>What is Ada?</h2>
      <p>
        Ada Developers Academy (Ada) is an intensive software developer training school for women. It combines six months of classroom instruction in cutting-edge web technologies with up to six month of apprenticeship at a Puget Sound-area tech business.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 24 week intensive class, students will be immersed in software development and learn the most up-to-date web skills from leading regional and national experts. Afterward, during a six month apprenticeship, students will learn what it’s like to be part of a software team delivering production code for real applications.
      </p>
      <p> Ada Developers Academy is a project of the <a href="http://www.technology-alliance.com/" target="blank">Technology Alliance</a>. The Technology Alliance is a statewide not-for-profit organization of leaders from Washington's technology-based businesses and research institutions united by our vision of a vibrant innovation economy that benefits all of our state's citizens.

      <h2>The Ada Curriculum</h2>
      <p>
        Ada Developers Academy will teach full-stack web development. Students will learn Ruby, Rails, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, students will learn how to work on agile development teams, using pair programming, scrum, and test-driven development. 
      </p>

      <h2>Why Ada?</h2>
      <p>
        Washington State has a major high-skilled labor shortage (25,000 unfilled high-skilled jobs and rising). 
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the most challenging roles to recruit within this labor pool is software developers, and over 85% of programmers are male. The lack of talent, combined with the gender gap, is problematic for Washington’s economy.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fill the unmet need and to help rectify the gender imbalance in software development, Washington needs a software development academy that prepares women for productive roles in technical positions. Ada Developers Academy is the solution.
      </p>

      <h2>Inclusivity</h2>
      <p>
        Ada Developers Academy is designed to be an inclusive, positive learning environment. Everyone is welcome, regardless of sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, education, age, race, or religion. All women (cis and trans) and people with non-binary gender who feel a part of women's community are encouraged to apply.

          <strong>Ada Lovelace</strong> was the first programmer. She worked with Charles Babbage on the construction and programming of the Analytical Engine. Although not implemented in her lifetime, her program to calculate a series of Bernoulli numbers was found to be functional and bug-free.
