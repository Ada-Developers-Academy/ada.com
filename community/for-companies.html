      <h2 class="clear_floats">Why Ada Developers Academy?</h2>
      <p class="emphasis center_text">Ada is training talented women to be awesome full-stack software developers.</p>
      <p>Washington State has a major high-skilled labor shortage (25,000 unfilled high-skilled jobs and rising). One of the most challenging roles to recruit within this labor pool is software developers, and over 85% of programmers are male. The lack of talent, combined with the gender gap, is problematic for Washington’s economy. To fill the unmet need and to help rectify the gender imbalance in software development, Washington needs a software development academy that prepares women for productive roles in technical positions. Ada Developers Academy is the solution. Ada Developers Academy is a year-long software development training program, with six months of intensive in-class work followed by a six month internship at a sponsoring company. Students gain practical experience working on project teams and will graduate fluent in the Ruby on Rails tech stack, with immediately transferrable experience for web development and mobile software development careers. Ada is community-supported, with the majority of its funding from sponsoring companies in Seattle and the greater Puget Sound region, though its initial seed funding was from Washington State’s Department of Commerce. </p>
     <h2 class="clear_floats">Our Students</h2>
     <p>Applicants are rigorously screened for technical aptitude and likely cultural fit for software engineering teams at our sponsoring companies, though no previous coding experience is expected. Over 100 women applied for the first cohort that started in October 2013. They were screened and interviewed by company engineering managers from our sponsoring companies – only 16 were accepted.Due to the length and depth of the program, students do not pay tuition – in fact, some receive small scholarships throughout the 12-month course. This model allows Ada to reach the broadest possible range of potential talent, regardless of their current financial situation. Within its first 2 years of operation, Ada plans to be graduating 4 cohorts of 20-25 women each year from its Seattle location.</p>
     <h2>Our Curriculum</h2>
     <p>Ada Developers’ Academy teaches full-stack web development, allowing students to choose what specialty of software development they want to pursue in their post-Ada careers. <img class="img_left spons_logo" src="/images/logos/316rails_logo.png" />Specifically, we cover HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and database fundamentals. The complete curriculum, with detailed lecture notes, mastery topics, evaluation questions, and daily deliverables, is online and open-source. It is available on <a href="https://github.com/Ada-Developers-Academy/curriculum">GitHub</a>.</p>
     <p>We chose Ruby on Rails not for its ubiquity, but for its ease of learning. <img class="img_right spons_logo" src="/images/logos/html5_logo_blk.png" />Ruby is a very English language-like programming language, which aids in rapid understanding. We do not anticipate all students will continue with Ruby on Rails after their Ada training. We’ll focus on teaching skills that are readily transferrable from one technology stack to another, making Ada students adaptable and flexible candidates for all types of junior developer positions.</p>
    <h2 class="clear_floats">Sponsoring Companies</h2>
    <p>To support the program, we ask companies to commit both money (to pay for instruction, student scholarships throughout the program and our other program costs) and employee time (to act as 1:1 mentors with students during the 6-month classroom immersion period and during the “hands on” internship period). The standard company sponsorship level is $25K and includes a 6-month intern placement.</p>
