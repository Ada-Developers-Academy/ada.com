We need your help! 

<h2>Individuals</h2>
The success of Ada Developers' Academy is completely dependent on donation. Please visit our Indiegogo campaign page to make a contribution, and please spread the word!

<h2>Companies</h2>
As a sponsoring company, you'll have access to ADA students for apprenticeships and potential hires. Please contact us if you're interested.

<h2>Software Developers</h2>
We're always looking for mentors, guest speakers, and curriculum collaborators. If you'd like to participate in the Ada Developer Academy community, please send us an email.

<h2>In-Kind Donation</h2>
We're running a busy classroom full of students and volunteers. If you or your company would like to make an in-kind donation (A/V equipment, supplies, snacks, coffee), please contact us!
