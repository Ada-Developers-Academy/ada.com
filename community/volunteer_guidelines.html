        <p>Volunteering is a rewarding and fun way to give back to your community. As a nonprofit, Ada Developers Academy depends on the generosity of our volunteers to help keep our program running smoothly. There are several ways that you can get involved. This page lists many of them, and we're always interested in hearing your ideas, as well.</p>

        <h2>Volunteer Guidelines</h2>
        <h3>Goal: Facilitate student learning.</h3>
        <p>Students should feel:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Socially comfortable</li>
          <li>Technically capable</li>
          <li>Trust in their instruction</li>
        </ul>

        <br> 
        <br> 

        <h3>Socially comfortable</h3>
        <p>Introduce yourself to students when you help them, and get their name in return.  </p>
        <p>Try to learn students' names. No one expects complete success, but give it a shot.</p>
        <p>Don't hit on people. Not other volunteers, not the instructors, not the students. </p>
        <p>Don't make gender-based generalizations ("Women are better at X becauseâ€¦").</p>
        <p>Don't use slurs or oppressive (sexist, racist, able-ist, etc) language. </p>
  
        <h3>Technically capable</h3>
        <p>Making mistakes is how we learn. Don't shame students for their errors, guide them to improve. </p>
        <p>Don't be surprised when a student hasn't heard of something before. </p>
        <p>Don't grab anyone's keyboard. Avoid taking over unless absolutely necessary, and then, ask before you do- "Mind if I drive for a second?"</p>
        <p>Be positive about questions. Good responses: "I wondered that, too" or "I'm glad you asked!" </p>
        <p>When trying to be accurate, it's easy to go down a rabbit hole of specificity. Avoid.</p>
        <p>After explaining a topic or solution, ask the student what questions they have- not if they have questions. They definitely have questions. </p>

        <h3>Trust in their instruction</h3>
        <p>No one knows everything, and there are a plethora of ways to accomplish the same goal. There is rarely one right answer to any technical question. </p>
        <p>Each week, in-class TAs receive a prep email that outlines topics to be covered in the class. Take the time to look it over before you come in to help.If the topics on your day are outside of your experience, ask for more guidance from a staff person when you come in, or simply bow out for that week.</p> 
        <p>If a student is trying to do something the way the instructor taught, it's okay to suggest alternate strategies, but do not disparage the instructor's methodology. </p>
        <p>Don't be afraid to correct students if they're wrong, but do so in a way that's polite and encouraging: "Well, this might work better and this is why."</p> 
        <p>If a student asks you something you don't know, it's okay to say you're not sure. Suggest that you look up a solution together. If you encounter a question that totally stymies you, it's perfectly fine to say that you're not the right person to answer it, then get an instructor or other TA to help out. </p>
        <p>Don't go too fast when talking through a solution. It's really easy to do.</p>
